# Mobilelinkd TNC 4

This is an interesting device in that it offers both bluetooth and USB sereial connectivity. Althought if connecting to a PC or Mac, use the serial port via the USB C port.  Bluetooth shows up as 2 serial ports.  One incoming and one outgoing.

## Window 11/AGWPE/Outpost Ipagwpe
This is just an organized brain dump.  Fee free to sumbit a PR or email notes. Happy to update.

As I get additional configurations working I'll add to this page.  I want to try direwolf from windows and raspberry pi.  Different radios, kenwood TH d-7a, yeasu vx-5. Sound card like the dinah.

### Connections
Use a cable to connect the USB C port on the mofem to your PC.
Ise the correct interface cable to connect to the radio. I am using a FT-8800.  So the 3.5mm TRRS audio connector/mini din 6 cable is what I am using for 1200 baud communication. The minidin M/F cable was not need for me.

#### TNC Setup Values
For the serial port, look at the device manager to figure out what what com port to use.

![portsetup](images/device_manager.png)

You see the bluetooth serial ports, com6 and com7, serapate com port for incoming and outgoing.  We will use the USB serial port, com8.

The first thing you want to do is setup the connection to your modem. You can see I have already set mine up. Click "New Port" to setup  new modem.  Select and click OK to edit one. These are saved in a file port0.ini and the backup in port0.old.

Duplicate these settings

![portsetup](images/agwpe_portsetup.png)

Duplicate these settings and click on "Default 1200}

![tnc commands](images/agwpe_tnc_commands.png)

Click OK to save the settings.

### outpost
When you install outpost it will add a series of icons to your desktop. Double click the "Ipagwpe" icon. Since we are using AGWPE, we use the TCP/IP connection on port 8000 to commmunicate with the modem via agwpe.

Select "Setup->Interface" to setup the TNC connnection. The only change you need to make is to set the "TNC RadioPort" as identified in the agwpe properties dialog.

Next you will select "setup->connection" to add set your callsign and the callsign of the station you want to connect to. I do not know of W1AW has a node. Click OK then you should be good to go.

Now click "connect", the the "BBS Connect" should become active.

### Troubleshooting
If  double check the settings. 
+ Make sure you see both the agwpe icon and the modem icon.
+ Make sure your radio is on set to the correct frequency. And set to the corrct speed.
+ If using the mini din 6, is it seated correctly? Do you need the  M/F cable ?
  Check the page for an explanation of this cable https://store.mobilinkd.com/collections/tnc-cables/products/minidin-6-1200-baud-adapter
+ Ipagwpe port and agwpe port match?
+ Baud rate for mode 115000?
